##Blog
My blog based on Spring Boot. 

	Implement a web application using Spring Boot and design front-end pages with Bootstrap and jQuery

	Utilize MySQL and Mybatis to manage data from users, posts, comments and notifications and use Redis for hot tags  

	Build exception handlers to deal with unsupported behaviors from users

	Connect users with GitHub to enable secure login and the blog allows users to post, delete, comment, search posts and remind users of new comments

	Develop a content management system through Shiro to let administrators better manage posts
